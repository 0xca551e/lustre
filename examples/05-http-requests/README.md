We haven't quite got round to documenting this example yet. If you know a little
bit about Lustre or Elm and want to help out, we'd love to have your help! Please
[open an issue](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues/new) if you have any
ideas or reach out to @hayleigh.dev on the [Gleam discord](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).

## Getting help

If you're having trouble with Lustre or not sure what the right way to do
something is, the best place to get help is the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).
You could also open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).

While our docs are still a work in progress, the official [Elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org)
is also a great resource for learning about the Model-View-Update architecture
and the kinds of patterns that Lustre is built around.
