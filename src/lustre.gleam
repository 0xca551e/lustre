// CONSTRUCTORS ----------------------------------------------------------------

/// Create a basic lustre program that just renders some element on the page.
/// Note that this doesn't mean the content is static! With `element.stateful`
/// you can still create components with local state.
///
/// Basic lustre programs don't have any *global* application state and so the
/// plumbing is a lot simpler. If you find yourself passing state 
///

    let init   = Nil
    let update = fn (_, _) { Nil }
    let render = fn (_) { element }

    Program(init, update, render)
}

/// Create a more complex application mimicing TEA â€“ the Elm architecture. We
/// start with some initial `state`, a function to update that state, and then
/// a render function to derive our program's view from that state.
///
///
